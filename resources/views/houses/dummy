Whether to add an alert indicating that the form has been reset is subjective and depends on the specific requirements and user experience you want to achieve. Here are some considerations:

User Feedback: Providing feedback to the user when they perform an action can enhance their understanding and confidence in the system. Displaying an alert when the form is reset can let the user know that their action has been acknowledged.

Visual Clarity: The blue-colored alert can create a clear visual indication that the form has been reset. It helps to differentiate the alert from other messages and draws the user's attention to the specific action they performed.

Consistency: If you already have alerts for other actions (such as successful form submission), adding an alert for form reset can maintain consistency in your user interface.

Minimal Impact: Adding the alert is a small enhancement that does not significantly affect the overall functionality of the form or the user experience. It can be a simple and subtle way to improve the user interface.

Ultimately, the decision to include the alert is up to you and your design preferences. Consider the context, the target users, and the overall design guidelines of your application. If you believe it adds value and improves the user experience, then it can be a worthwhile addition.
